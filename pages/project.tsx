      that ensure smooth and successful projects.

        <div className={styles.subhead1}>Benefits of Outsourced IT Project Management
        </div>
        <div className={styles.Body2}>Efficient: Utilizing an experienced project manager will help you stay on budget and on schedule. Without the knowledge 
        and experience required for IT project management, you could be looking at cost over runs, unexpected delays and security holes as your internal 
        resources learn on the job.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Effective: Keep your business running smoothly and free of added stress. We handle the planning and co-ordination so your key staff can stay focused 
        on their daily responsibilities. Having an outside perspective also provides the advantage of objectivity, because office politics, relationships, 
        and personal attachments to a project can cause delays and slow your progress.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Secure: Whether adding functionality, improving collaboration or completely overhauling your network, success will require that any new system is secured. 
        Each step of your project will include security oversight to protect your business and clients as your new technology is implemented.
